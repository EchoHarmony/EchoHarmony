- 👋 Hi, I haven't thought of a name yet. It is really difficult for me to choose a nice name. I am a university teacher, I am from China. My English is not very good, but I think it is enough to write code.Of course, if my lucky friends are willing to teach me, I am happy to learn.If you can, please help me to choose a name that suits my temperament.
- 👀 I’m interested in python, django and artificial intelligence.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and django. They are very interesting and powerful.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on website development to enrich my project experience. Because I lack project experience. If someone is willing to teach me something about artificial intelligence, I will be very grateful.
- 📫 You can contact me through my Google email. My email address is a15398616252@gmail.com.
- 😄 Pronouns: I didn't think it over.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I didn't think it over....
